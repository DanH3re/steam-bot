Version. 0.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to use? :
1. First you need node to launch it.
2. Then you need to edit the json files and set it how do you want.
The JSON File:

{
	"username":"", // Your username for bot to log-in
	"password":"", // Your username for bot to log-in
	"toWho":"", // To who you want to send the comment/message (ID)
	"comment":"", // The text of the comment/message
	"commentInterval":"" // The interval between comments/messages
}

3. Run "runBotComments.bat" or "runBotMessage.bat" and let the fun start

Also:
If you are afraid of your account, you can check the code of the bot, it's not encrypted.
I guarantee you, if this is not a modificated version, you will have no problems. Be carefull!
